This lab on Cross-Validation and Bootstrap in R comes from p. 190-197 of "Introduction to Statistical Learning 
with Applications in R" by Gareth James, Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie and Robert Tibshirani. It was 
re-implemented in Fall 2016 in `tidyverse` format by Amelia McNamara and R. Jordan Crouser at Smith College.
It was then modified a bit by me for using the `caret` package, plus some notation and using the preffered 
`<-` operator.

# 5.3.1 The Validation Set Approach

In this section, we'll explore the use of the validation set approach in order to estimate the
test error rates that result from fitting various linear models on the `Auto`data set.

Before we begin, we use the `set.seed()`function in order to set a seed for `R`'s random number generator, so 
that you'll obtain precisely the same results as those shown in the textbook. It is generally a good idea to set 
a random seed when performing an analysis such as cross-validationthat contains an element of randomness, so that 
the results obtained can be reproduced precisely at a later time.

We begin by using the `sample_n()` and `setdiff()` functions to split the set of observations into two halves. 
We'll start by selecting a random subset of 196 observations out of the original 392 observations. We refer to 
these observations as the training set.

```{r}
set.seed(1)

train <- Auto %>%
  sample_n(196)

test <- Auto %>%
  setdiff(train)
```

We then use `lm()`to fit a linear regression using only the observations corresponding to the training set.

```{r}
model_lr <- train(mpg ~ horsepower, 
                  data = train,
                  method = 'lm')
```

We now use the `predict()` function to estimate the response for the test observations, and we use the `mean()` 
function to calculate the MSE of the 196 observations in the test set:

```{r}
test <- test %>%
  mutate(predictions_slr = predict(model_lr, test))

test %>%
  summarize(mse_slr = mean((mpg-predictions_lr)^2))
```

Therefore, the estimated test MSE for the linear regression fit is 26.14. We can use the `poly()` function to 
estimate the test error for the quadratic and cubic regressions.

```{r}
model_quad <- train(mpg ~ poly(horsepower,2), 
                    data = train,
                    method = 'lm')
test <- test %>%
  mutate(predictions_quad = predict(model_quad, test))
test %>% 
  summarize(MSE_quad = mean((mpg-predictions_quad)^2))


model_cubic <-train(mpg ~ poly(horsepower,3),
                    data = train,
                    method = 'lm')
test <- test %>%
  mutate(predictions_cubic = predict(model_cubic, test))
test %>%
  summarize(MSE_cubic = mean((mpg-predictions_cubic)^2))
```

These error rates are 19.82 and 19.78, respectively. If we choose a different training set instead, then we will 
obtain somewhat different errors on the validation set. We can test this out by setting a different random seed:

```{r}
set.seed(2)

train <- Auto %>%
  sample_n(196)

test <- Auto %>%
  setdiff(train)

model_lr2 <- train(mpg ~ horsepower, 
                   data = train,
                   method = 'lm')

test <- test %>%
  mutate(predictions_slr = predict(model_lr2, test))

model_quad2 <- train(mpg ~ poly(horsepower,2),
                     data = train,
                     method = 'lm')

test <- test %>%
  mutate(predictions_quad = predict(model_quad2, test))

model_cubic2 <- train(mpg~poly(horsepower,3),
                   data=train,
                   method = 'lm')

test <- test %>%
  mutate(predictions_cubic =  predict(model_cubic2, test))

test %>%
  summarize(MSE_slr = mean((mpg-predictions_slr)^2),
            MSE_quad = mean((mpg - predictions_quad)^2),
            MSE_cube = mean((mpg - predictions_cubic)^2))
```

Using this split of the observations into a training set and a validation set, we find that the validation set 
error rates for the models with linear, quadratic, and cubic terms are 23.30, 18.90, and 19.26, respectively.

These results are consistent with our previous findings: a model that predicts `mpg` using a quadratic function 
of `horsepower` performs better than a model that involves only a linear function of `horsepower`, and there is
little evidence in favor of a model that uses a cubic function of `horsepower`.

# 5.3.2 Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation

The LOOCV estimate can be automatically computed for any generalized linear model using the `glm()` and 
`cv.glm()` functions. In the lab for Chapter 4, we used the `glm()` function to perform logistic regression by 
passing in the `family = "binomial"` argument. But if we use `glm()` to fit a model without passing in the family 
argument, then it performs linear regression, just like the `lm()` function. The following should yield identical 
models:

```{r}
model_glr <- train(mpg ~ horsepower, 
                   data = Auto,
                   method = 'lm')
coef(model_glr$finalModel)

model_lr <- train(mpg ~ horsepower, 
                  data = Auto,
                  method = 'glm')
coef(model_lr$finalModel)
```

In this lab, we will perform linear regression using the `glm()` function rather than the `lm()` function because
the latter can be used together with `cv.glm()` to perform cross-validation. The `cv.glm()` function is part of 
the `boot` library.

```{r}
train_control <- trainControl(method = "LOOCV")

model_glr <- train(mpg~horsepower, 
                   data=Auto,
                   method = 'glm',
                   trControl = train_control)

cv_error <- (model_glr$results$RMSE)^2
cv_error
```

The `cv.glm()` function produces a list with several components. The two numbers in the delta vector contain the 
cross-validation results. In this case the numbers are identical (up to two decimal places) and correspond to the 
LOOCV statistic: our cross-validation estimate for the test error is approximately 24.23. Below, we'll discuss a 
situation in which the two numbers differ. 
Since we are using caret, what maters is that the model saves the RMSE in `results`, which is the square root of
the first delta measurement above.

We can repeat this procedure for increasingly complex polynomial fits. To automate the process, we use the 
`for()`function to initiate a for loop which iteratively fits polynomial regressions for polynomials of order 
`i = 1` to `i = 5` and computes the associated cross-validation error. 

This command may take a couple of minutes to run.

```{r}
mse <- rep(x = 0, times = 5)
train_control <- trainControl(method = 'LOOCV')

for(i in 1:5){
  f <- bquote(mpg ~ poly(horsepower, .(i))) %>%
    as.formula()
  model_glr <- train(f, 
                     data=Auto,
                     method = 'glm',
                     trControl = train_control)
  mse[i] <- (model_glr$results$RMSE)^2
}
mse
```

Here we see a sharp drop in the estimated test MSE between the linear and quadratic fits, but then no clear 
improvement from using higher-order polynomials.

# 5.3.3 k-Fold Cross-Validation

The `cv.glm()` function can also be used to implement `k`-fold CV. Below we use `k = 10`, a common choice for
`k`, on the `Auto` data set. We once again set a random seed and initialize a vector in which we will store the
CV errors corresponding to the polynomial fits of orders one to ten.

```{r}

set.seed(1)
mse <- rep(0, 5)
train_control <- trainControl(method = 'cv', number = 10)

for (i in 1:10){
  f <- bquote(mpg ~ poly(horsepower, .(i))) %>%
    as.formula()
  model_glr <- train(f,
                     data = Auto,
                     method = 'glm',
                     trControl = train_control)
  mse[i] <-(model_glr$results$RMSE)^2
}
mse
```

Notice that the computation time is **much** shorter than that of LOOCV.
(In principle, the computation time for LOOCV for a least squares linear model should be faster than for `k`-fold 
CV, due to the availability of the formula (5.2) for LOOCV; however, unfortunately the `cv.glm()` functiondoes 
not make use of this formula.) We still see little evidence that using cubic or higher-order polynomial terms 
leads to lower test error than simply using a quadratic fit.

We saw in Section 5.3.2 that the two numbers associated with delta are essentially the same when LOOCV is 
performed. When we instead perform `k`-fold CV, then the two numbers associated with delta differ slightly. The 
first is the standard `k`-fold CV estimate, as in (5.3). The second is a bias-corrected version. On this data 
set, the two estimates are very similar toeach other.

# An Application to Default Data

Now that you're armed with more useful technique for resampling your data, let's try fitting a model for the 
`Default` dataset:

```{r}
summary(Default)
```

First we'll try just holding out a random 20% of the data:

```{r}
for (i in 1:10){

    set.seed(i)

    train <- Default %>%
      sample_frac(0.2)

    test <- Default %>%
      setdiff(train)

    # Fit a logistic regression to predict default using balance
    model_logistic  <- train(default ~ balance + student, 
                       data = train,
                       method = 'glm',
                       family = binomial)

    # Use the model to predict the response on the test data
    glm_pred <- predict(model_logistic, test)

    glm_pred <- cbind(test, pred = glm_pred)

    result <- glm_pred %>%
      summarize(score = mean(pred == default))
    
    print(result)
}
```

Our accuracy is really high on this data, but we're getting different error rates depending on how we choose our 
test set. That's no good!

Unfortunately this dataset is too big for us to run LOOCV, so we'll have to settle for `k`-fold. In the space 
below, build a logistic model on the full `Default`dataset and then run 5-fold cross-validation to get a more 
accurate estimate of your test error rate:

```{r}
train_control <- trainControl(method = 'cv', number = 10, repeats = 5)
model_lognew <- train(default ~ balance + student,
                      data = Default,
                      method = 'glm',
                      family = binomial,
                      trControl = train_control)
predictions <- predict(model_lognew, test)
mean(predictions == test$default )
```

# 5.3.4 The Bootstrap

We illustrate the use of the bootstrap in the simple example of Section 5.2, as well as on an example involving 
estimating the accuracy of the linear regression model on the `Auto`data set.

# Estimating the Accuracy of a Statistic of Interest

One of the great advantages of the bootstrap approach is that it can be applied in almost all situations. No 
complicated mathematical calculations are required. Performing a bootstrap analysis in R entails only two steps.

- First, we must create a function that computes the statistic of interest.
- Second, we use the `boot()` function, which is part of the boot library, to perform the bootstrap by repeatedly sampling observations from the data set with replacement.

The `Portfolio`data set in the `ISLR` package is described in Section 5.2. It has variables called `X` and `Y`. 
To illustrate the use of the bootstrap on this data, we must first create
a function, `calculate_alpha()`, which takes as input the data and outputs the estimate for $\alpha$ (described 
in more detail on page 187).

```{r}
calculate_alpha <- function(data){
  Y <- data$Y
  X <- data$X
  alpha <- (var(Y)-cov(X,Y))/(var(X)+var(Y)-2*cov(X,Y))
  return(alpha)
}

bs_alpha <- function(data){
  data <- as.data.frame(data)
  calculate_alpha(data)
}

boot_alpha <- function(data, index){
  Y <- data$Y[index]
  X <- data$X[index]
  alpha <- (var(Y)-cov(X,Y))/(var(X)+var(Y)-2*cov(X,Y))
  return(alpha)
}
```

This function returns, or outputs, an estimate for $\alpha$ based on applying (5.7) to the observations indexed
by the argument index. For instance, the following command tells `R` to estimate $\alpha$ using all 100 
observations.

```{r}
Portfolio %>%
  slice(1:100) %>%
  calculate_alpha()
```

The next command uses the `sample()` function to randomly select 100 observations from the range 1 to 100, with 
replacement. This is equivalent to constructing a new bootstrap data set and recomputing $\hat{\alpha}$ based on 
the new data set.

```{r}
set.seed(1)
Portfolio %>%
  sample_n(100, replace=TRUE) %>%
  calculate_alpha()
```

We can implement a bootstrap analysis by performing this command many times, recording all of the corresponding 
estimates for $\alpha$, and computing the resulting standard deviation. However, the `boot()`function automates
this approach. Below we produce $R = 1,000$ bootstrap estimates for $\alpha$:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
bs_pf <- Portfolio %>%
  modelr::bootstrap(1000) 

bs_pf <- bs_pf %>%
  mutate(alpha = map(strap, bs_alpha))

sd(unlist(bs_pf$alpha))
calculate_alpha(Portfolio)

boot(Portfolio, boot_alpha, R = 1000)
```

The final output shows that using the original data, $\hat{\alpha} = 0.5758$, and that the bootstrap estimate for $SE(\hat{\alpha})$ is 0.0886.

# Estimating the Accuracy of a Linear Regression Model

The bootstrap approach can be used to assess the variability of the coefficient estimates and predictions from a 
statistical learning method. Here we use the bootstrap approach in order to assess the variability of the 
estimates for $\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$, the intercept and slope terms for the linear regression model that uses 
horsepower to predict mpg in the `Auto` data set. We will compare the estimates obtained using the bootstrap to 
those obtained using the formulas for $SE(\hat{\beta}_0)$ and $SE(\hat{\beta}_1)$ described in Section 3.1.2.

We first create a simple function, `fn_model()`, which takes in the `Auto` data set as well as a set of indices 
for the observations, and returns the intercept and slope estimates for the linear regression model. We then 
apply this function to the full set of 392 observations in order to compute the estimates of $\beta_0$ and 
$\beta_1$ on the entire data set using the usual linear regression coefficient estimate formulas from Chapter 3. 

```{r}
fn_model <- function(data){
  model <- train(mpg ~ horsepower, 
                 data = as.data.frame(data),
                 method = 'lm')
  return(model$finalModel)
}

Auto %>% fn_model() %>% coef()
```

The `fn_model()`function can also be used in order to create bootstrap estimates for the intercept and slope
terms by randomly sampling from among the observations with replacement. Here we give two examples:


```{r}
set.seed(1)

Auto %>%
  modelr::bootstrap(1) %>%
  mutate(model = map(strap, fn_model))  %>%
  mutate(param = map(model, tidy)) %>%
  select(.id, param) %>%
  unnest() %>%
  print()
```


Next, we use the `bootstrap()`function to compute the standard errors of 1,000 bootstrap estimates for the 
intercept and slope terms:

```{r}
bs_se <- function(stat){
  B <- length(stat)
  se <- sqrt(
    (1/(B-1)) * 
      sum((stat - (1/B)*sum(stat))^2)
    )
  return(se)
}

set.seed(1)
Auto %>%
  modelr::bootstrap(1000) %>%
  mutate(model = map(strap, fn_model)) %>%
  mutate(param = map(model, tidy)) %>%
  select(.id, param) %>%
  unnest() %>%
  group_by(term) %>%
  summarize(estimate = mean(estimate), std_error = mean(std.error)) %>%
  print()
```

This indicates that the bootstrap estimate for $SE(\hat\beta_0)$ is 0.716, and that the bootstrap estimate for 
$SE(\hat\beta_1)$ is 0.0064. As discussed in Section 3.1.2, standard formulas can be used to compute the standard 
errors for the regression coefficients in a linear model. These can be obtained using the `summary()`function:

```{r}
summary(lm(mpg~horsepower, data=Auto))
```

Note that the standard error estimates produced by the `summary()` function were a little different from the 
estimates obtained using the bootstrap. Does this indicate a problem with the bootstrap? In fact, it's just the 
opposite!

Recall that we found previously that the relationship between `horsepower` and `mpg` is better characterized by a 
quadratic model. Let's see how the error rates compare when we fit that instead of a linear model:

```{r}
fit_quad <- function(data){
  model <- train(mpg~horsepower + I(horsepower^2) ,
        data=as.data.frame(data),
        method = 'lm')
  return(model$finalModel)
}

set.seed(1)
Auto_bootstrap <- Auto %>%
  modelr::bootstrap(1000) %>%
  mutate(model = map(strap, fit_quad)) %>%
  mutate(param = map(model, tidy)) %>%
  select(.id, param) %>%
  unnest() %>%
  group_by(term) %>%
  summarize(estimate = mean(estimate), std_error = mean(std.error)) %>%
  print()
```

```{r}
summary(lm(mpg~horsepower + I(horsepower^2), data=Auto))
```

Since this model provides a good fit to the data, there is now a better correspondence between the bootstrap 
estimates and the standard estimates of $SE(\hat\beta_0), SE(\hat\beta_1)$ and $SE(\hat\beta_2)$.
